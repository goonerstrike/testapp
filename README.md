# Flask Sample Application

This repository provides a sample Python web application implemented using the Flask web framework and hosted using ``gunicorn``. It is intended to be used to demonstrate deployment of Python web applications to OpenShift 3.x

I am currently printing some information on where the app is being served to see what will be output when I put this on OpenShift.

The pig latin output was inspired by my 7th-grade daughter doing her pig latin app for Code Academy this weekend. I think I took a shortcut and made my code compact, but maybe I'll use her code later to make her happy. :)
